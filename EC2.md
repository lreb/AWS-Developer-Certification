# EC2 or Elastic Compute Cloud
This is a utility designed to manage variable workloads and gives clients the ability to afford on-demand computing sources for hosting. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud which has been designed to provide its customers with resizable and scalable computing capacity when they are using the cloud. Using the service of Amazon EC2, a client is able to launch as many virtual servers as he wants. In each of these virtual servers, the client is able to manage storage as well as configure security as and when needed. The main advantage of using Amazon EC2 is its ability to get everything done with minimal friction at all times.

- AWS Elastic Compute Cloud is a computing web service which provides resizable, secure, and reliable capacity in the cloud
- You have complete control of your EC2 computing resources.
- You can scale up or scale down the capacity of your EC2 resources as your technical requirements change
- You must pay only for EC2 resources that you use (hour)
- You can build and boot new computing instances in only some little minutes
- Use several OS
- Use market place AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
- Configure network and security yourself
- Manage status: terminates, start, reboot
- Can use SDK to handle it
