# AWS - amazon web service
platform which is designed to provide secure cloud services, computing power to clients, database storage options, content delivery and many other services which are all intended towards business development and growth.

Software developers can then focus on business logic. The other choices are not the most significant advantages of a component-based development approach.

-  The scope of an IS audit is defined by its objectives. This involves identifying control weaknesses relevant to the scope of the audit. Obtaining sufficient and appropriate evidence assists the auditor in not only identifying weaknesses but also in documenting and validating them. Complying with regulatory requirements, ensuring coverage, and the execution of audit are all relevant to an audit but are not the reason why sufficient and relevant evidence is required.
